 🗺️ Shortest Path Visualizer using Dijkstra's Algorithm (Tkinter + Python)

This project is a Python-based graphical application that visualizes the shortest path between cities using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**. Built with **Tkinter**, it offers an interactive experience with map-like visuals representing cities and their connections.


🚀 Features

- 🧠 Implements **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** for accurate shortest path calculation  
- 🗺️ **Realistic Indian state maps** with at least 13 cities per map  
- 🔁 Easily switch between maps using the **"Next Map"** button  
- 🎯 Clickable city nodes for **source and destination selection**  
- 🎨 Simple and clean **Tkinter-based GUI**  
- 📚 Ideal for students, educators, and algorithm learners


🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Tkinter (for GUI)  
- Custom graphics to simulate real maps

💡 Future Improvements
- Add support for more pathfinding algorithms (A*, BFS, etc.)
- Add zoom and pan functionality
- Allow user to create custom maps
